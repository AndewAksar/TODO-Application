# Task Index

This folder contains the step-by-step development plan for the project.

## Rules
- Follow tasks in order unless a task explicitly says otherwise.
- Each task is small and incremental.
- Do not expand scope beyond what the task allows.
- Protected core rules are enforced via `AGENTS.md`.

## Current sequence (early stage)
- 010 — Shared event models (`docs/tasks/010-shared-events.md`)

## Next tasks (planned)
- 020 — TODO service skeleton (FastAPI app scaffold, no DB logic yet)
- 030 — Auth service skeleton (JWT issuing scaffold)
- 040 — Local Kafka + Postgres infra (docker-compose)
